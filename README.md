# Dijkstra Algorithm GUI Implementation

Dijkstra's algorithm (or Dijkstra's Shortest Path First algorithm, SPF algorithm) is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later..

This software is an reference for another Application 

### Tech

This application uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) - Modules designed for writing video games

And of course this application itself is open source with a public repository on GitHub.

### Installation

This application requires [Python](https://www.python.org/) to be installed in your computer.

Install the necessary modules using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).

```sh
$ cd dijkstra-alg-gui
$ pip install pygame
$ python dijkstra-alg-gui.py
```

**Free Software, Hell Yeah!** </br>
This software is used to understand the dijkstra algorithm in gui manner and it also developed with the help of [ChrisKneller](https://github.com/ChrisKneller)
